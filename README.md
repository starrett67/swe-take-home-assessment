- A set can consist of the time spend on the set or it can be a combination of weight + reps
- User should be able to save and view previous exercises
- All data that is in an exercise must be stored/read from a backend service

### Back End
- Must support all the CRUD operations related to exercises
- Feel free to use REST or GraphQL
- Must use some sort of persistence storage for exercise data

#### Tech Stack
- Must use javascript framework
- Other then that use whatever you want just dont copy other peoples code.

## Additonal Notes
- If you have any questions feel free to reach out or be creative and fill any blanks yourself (we can talk about it in follow up interview)
- Bonus points if you can get the entire app up and running with one command! Front-end + back-end + database
- Dont go too crazy! This assigment is only meant to take a few hours. We want to get to know what kind of developer you are.
- There is no time constraint! Everyone has busy lives so take your time. The faster you get it done the faster we move on to an interview but dont rush and do a bad job.

## Sumbitting your assignment
- Simply upload your project to github public repoistory and provide the link to the recruiter
